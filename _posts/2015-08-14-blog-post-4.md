Inverse Graphics (IG) is the process of disentangling an image into physical variables that contain information about its constituent properties such as its shape, color, material, position, rotation etc. This task is often equated with "analysis by synthesis" and is needed to recreate scenes that are only available as single 2D/3D images. 
The biggest problem with IG is that it is very difficult to generalize features such as comprehensive understanding of a 3D environment's spatial and physical properties. This limits their ability to generalize hugely. In the recent past, different approaches to solve this problem has ben researched. This research's goal is to find a new approach to solving this problem, thus creating graphics programs that are able to reproduce the scenes using a traditional graphics engine.

The authors are planning to leverage the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) as LLMs exhibit compositional reasoning abilities that could be beneficial for spatial reasoning in 3D tasks. In order to achieve this, they propose the Inverse-Graphics Large Language Model (IG-LLM): an inverse graphics framework centered around an LLM, that transforms a visual embedding into a structured, compositional 3D-scene representation autoregressively. This process works beyond mere pixel- or object-level interpretation of an image and tries to find physical relationships among essential objects of the scene.

What could IG-LLM do?
------
Through the use of an incorporated frozen pre-trained visual encoder and a continuous numeric head to enable end-to-end training, the IG-LLMs could theoretically solve the IG problem through next-token prediction without needing to use image-space supervision. This research opens up new possibilities to exploit the visual knowledge of LLMs for solving IG problems.
